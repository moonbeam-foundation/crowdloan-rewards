//! # Crowdloan Rewards Pallet
//!
//! This pallet issues rewards to citizens who participated in a crowdloan on the backing relay
//! chain (eg Kusama) in order to help this parrachain acquire a parachain slot.
//!
//! ## Monetary Policy
//!
//! This is simple and mock for now. We can do whatever we want.
//! This pallet stores a constant  "reward ratio" which is the number of reward tokens to pay per
//! contributed token. In simple cases this can be 1, but needs to be customizeable to allow for
//! vastly differing absolute token supplies between relay and para.
//! Vesting is also linear. No tokens are vested at genesis and they unlock linearly until a
//! predecided block number. Vesting computations happen on demand when payouts are requested. So
//! no block weight is ever wasted on this, and there is no "base-line" cost of updating vestings.
//! Like I said, we can anything we want there. Even a non-linear reward curve to disincentivize
//! whales.
//!
//! ## Payout Mechanism
//!
//! The current payout mechanism requires contributors to claim their payouts. Because they are
//! paying the transaction fees for this themselves, they can do it as often as every block, or
//! wait and claim the entire thing once it is fully vested. We could consider auto payouts if we
//! want.
//!
//! ## Sourcing Contribution Information
//!
//! The pallet can learn about the crowdloan contributions in several ways.
//!
//! * **Through the initialize_reward_vec extrinsic*
//!
//! The simplest way is to call the initialize_reward_vec through a democracy proposal/sudo call.
//! This makes sense in a scenario where the crowdloan took place entirely offchain.
//! This extrinsic initializes the associated and unassociated stoerage with the provided data
//!
//! * **ReadingRelayState**
//!
//! The most elegant, but most complex solution would be for the para to read the contributions
//! directly from the relay state. Blocked by https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/issues/320 so
//! I won't pursue it further right now. I can't decide whether that would really add security /
//! trustlessness, or is just a sexy blockchain thing to do. Contributors can always audit the
//! democracy proposal and make sure their contribution is in it, so in that sense reading relay state
//! isn't necessary. But if a single contribution is left out, the rest of the contributors might
//! not care enough to delay network launch. The little guy might get censored.
